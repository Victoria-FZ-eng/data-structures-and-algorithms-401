# Stacks and Queues
Stacks and Queues are data structures , similar to Linked-List.

## Challenge
Implementing Stack and Queue and test their implemented methods(peak, isEmpty, push, enqueue, pop, dequeue).

## Approach & Efficiency
I started by creating Node class then Stack and Queue, then creating methods and test them.
**Big (O)** for time would be **O(1)** because there are no loops, and for space is **O(n)** Because we used the classes and in my methods i used an ArrayList to make it easier for me to have the stack and queue printed

## API
Stack:

push -> add to top

pop-> remove from top

peak-> get top value

isEmpty-> true for non-empty stack and false for empty 

Queue:

enqueue-> add to rear

dequeue-> remove from front

peak-> get front value

isEmpty-> true for non-empty queue and false for empty .

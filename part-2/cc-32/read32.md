# Challenge Summary
Create the function (tree intersection) , that find the similar values in the tree.
Input: 2 binary trees.
Output: array of integers.

## Whiteboard Process
![intersection](.\hashmap-tree-intersection.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
Time = O(Log(n))  becuse we called functions inside other functions

Space = O(n) because of using objects and arrays

## Solution
ex. 

nums1: [10, 15, 20, 15, 10, 25]

nums2: [65, 10, 25, 1]

output --> [10, 25]

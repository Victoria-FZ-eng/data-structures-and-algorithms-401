# Challenge Summary
Given a k-ary tree return a new tree with node values :
"Fizz" if node's value is  divisible by 3,
"Buzz" if node's value is  divisible by 5,
"FizzBuzz" if node's value is  divisible by 5 & 3,
else value to string.

## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->

## Approach & Efficiency
using ArrayList object,  Big O space and time = O(n).

## Solution
input nodes= [0,5,3,15] - output [FizzBuzz, Buzz, Fizz, FizzBuzz]

the example in the above whiteboard is more clear.

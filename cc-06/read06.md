## Approach & Efficiency
I spent most of the time trying to solve the adding before and after specific node, I got stuck in the if condition for hours!

Method append -->Big(O) = O(1) for and O(n) for space

Method insertBefore -->Big(O) = O(n) for space and time

Method insertAfter -->Big(O) = O(n) for space and time

## Solution
append(value);
addAfter(value, valueToAdd);
addBefore(value,valueToAdd);
